## Abstract
Our goal is to be able to classify a Twitter user as belonging to a left political party or a right political party by analyzing their Tweets. In our study, we will start from scratch: we’ll collect the data, preprocess it, clean it, plot the training data into algorithms of our choice using Python and analyze the findings. Later, we will apply these algorithms to our test data in order to evaluate the accuracy of each model and choose the one that’s most convenient with our purposes.
